<h1>This is a K-means Cluster implementation in Python, with Pandas, Sklearn (K-means algorithm, preprocessing and metrics), and Matplotlib.</h1>

For search the perfect number of clusters, the Elbow method was used. Read more <a href="https://www.datanovia.com/en/lessons/determining-the-optimal-number-of-clusters-3-must-know-methods/">here</a>.

For avaliating the result, I'm used the Calinski and Harabaz Score. You find <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/stats/clustering.evaluation.calinskiharabaszevaluation-class.html">here</a>.

So, this is a experimental implementation. You can use on your search, but, exist best implementations around internet.

Let's go.

First, <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">install Python</a>.

Second, <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">install Pandas</a>, <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/">install Sklearn</a>, and <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">install Matplotlib</a>.

Now, create a folder and drop the monthour.csv. This data is a relacional list of hour and month Boston crimes. This data is discretized. Here the original dataset <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ankkur13/boston-crime-data">data</a>. The objective is find relations of group used the month and hour atributtes. 

Third, find the perfect K with Elbow method. 

Fourth,
